# algorithm-sorting-visualizer

*Not yet finished*

## About the Project

### Info
    * This a sorting algorithm with many of the main sorting algorithms discussed computer science classes.
    It has a main menu where you can select a number of options to customize how the algorithm 
    behaves and the affect the array that is being sorted.
### Built With
    This desktop aplication was built with Java and the Java Swing UI library. 
### Usage
    When this project is completed there will be a jar file for download to run the program.
    
## Completely Refactor code.
    * Seperate the Graphics Painting and Sorting into there own threads that way the sorting doesnt effect the visualization 
    and the sorting can be slowed down to a speed the user selected.
    * Make the SortingAlgorithm abstract class more general purpose so i can more easily implement new algorithm.
